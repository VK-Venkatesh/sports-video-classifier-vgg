# sports-video-classifier-vgg
A deep learning project that classifies sports videos based on frame-by-frame analysis using a pretrained VGG model. The system extracts frames from videos, preprocesses them, and applies a CNN-based model for sports category prediction. Designed for applications in video analytics, sports content tagging, and intelligent highlight generation.
